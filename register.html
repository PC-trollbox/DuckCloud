		Description about this page:
		<br>
		<em>DuckCloud allows you to create free virtual machines using powerful Docker container technology.</em>
		<br>
		Note to DuckCloud secrets: Do not use any of your passwords you already use on other services; possibly create a strong secret with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, number and symbol characters; do not use your personal information when creating a secret; use at least 8 characters, more is better; consider using a password manager to store the secret if you have trouble remembering it.
